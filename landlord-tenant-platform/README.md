# CryptoRent Platform

A blockchain-powered rental agreement platform that enables secure cryptocurrency payments, escrow services, and yield generation for landlords and tenants.

## Features

- üè† **Digital Rental Agreements**: Create, sign, and manage rental agreements on the blockchain
- üí∞ **Cryptocurrency Payments**: Support for PYUSD (Ethereum Sepolia) and USDF (Flow EVM)
- üîí **Secure Escrow**: Security deposits held in smart contract escrows
- üìà **Yield Generation**: Landlords earn yield on deposited security funds through staking
- üéÅ **Tenant Rewards**: Tenants receive rewards for timely rent payments
- üîê **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask and other Web3 wallet support

## Supported Networks

### Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 11155111
- **Currency**: PYUSD (PayPal USD)
- **Contract**: `0xCaC524BcA292aaade2DF8A05cC58F0a65B1B3bB9`

### Flow EVM Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 545 (0x221)
- **RPC URL**: `https://testnet.evm.nodes.onflow.org`
- **Currency**: USDF (USD Stablecoin)
- **Contract**: TBA (Placeholder in .env)

## How It Works

1. **Create Agreement**: Landlord creates a rental agreement with property details, rent amount, and security deposit requirements
2. **Tenant Signs & Deposits**: Tenant reviews, signs the agreement, and deposits security amount in cryptocurrency to escrow
3. **Agreement Activation**: Landlord confirms and activates the agreement
4. **Ongoing Benefits**: 
   - Landlord earns yield on deposited security funds
   - Tenant pays monthly rent and receives rewards
   - All transactions are transparent and secure

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Sepolia) + Flow EVM
- **Web3**: Ethers.js + Web3React
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons
- **Notifications**: React Toastify

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
